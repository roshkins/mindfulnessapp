  <h1> Competitive attention spanning</h1>
  <h2>How long can you go without getting lost in your thoughts? </h2>
  <h3>Keep your trains of thought running</h3>
  <p> Your goal is to notice when a duration has elapsed and click the button as soon as possible afterwards, without clicking too soon or late. Click the button once to begin, the duration increases by a second each round you get it within a 10% + 1 second
    of the duration. Notice what techniques you used. You can also practice with distractions, like playing music or having tax documents up. What worked? What's your high score? What's your longest streak without making a mistake?:
    <h2>Common durations</h2>
